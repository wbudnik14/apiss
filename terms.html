          1.3. The GTCS shall apply to all contracts concluded between Apiss and

        <p>
          1.4. The application of any general terms and conditions (contract

        </p>
        <p>

        <h5>2. Awarding of the contract.</h5>
        <p>
          2.1. The contract is concluded by the Client submitting an order to
          Apiss to perform a service or sale of goods by Apiss on the basis of
          Apiss' offer or without such an offer, which integral part is the

          Apiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2. The Client’s order shall be deemed accepted if Apiss confirms the
          acceptance of the order in documentary form (in writing, by e-mail or
          by fax).
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3. The conclusion of the contract shall mean acceptance of the GTCS
          by the Client.
        </p>
        <h5>3. Performance of an order to provide services.</h5>
        <p>
          3.1. Apiss performs services within the time specified in the accepted
          order. Apiss guarantees the performance of services within the agreed
          time on condition that the Client performs all the necessary actions
          for the proper order performance by Apiss, in particular, provides the
          relevant parts, materials and documentation, as well as makes
          available the appropriate place to perform the services.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2. The Client shall be obliged, at its own expense, to provide
          Apiss, during the performance of services, with access to electricity,
          drinking water, a properly secured place for storing tools and a
          social room for Apiss’ personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.3. The Client is obliged to cooperate fully with Apiss in order for
          Apiss to properly perform the services.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4. If in the place of performing services by Apiss, there are
          internal procedures, regulations, fire and occupational health and
          safety regulations in force, the Client is obliged to train Apiss'
          personnel in this field free of charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5. If, in the event of the Client's delay in the performance of its
          obligations provided for in sections 3.1 - 3.4 above, Apiss could not
          provide services despite its readiness, the Client shall be obliged to
          pay remuneration for Apiss' readiness to provide services in the
          amount determined in the order.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.6. If the delay referred to in paragraph 3.5 above exceeds 5 days,
          Apiss shall be entitled, but not obliged, to withdraw from the
          contract. In this case, the Client shall pay Apiss remuneration for
          the period of readiness to provide services in the amount established
          in the order, as well as reimburse Apiss for the expenses incurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.7. All transport costs related to the execution of the order,
          including travel costs of Apiss personnel to and from the place of
          service provision, local travel costs and costs of accommodation and
          meals of Apiss’ personnel, shall be borne by the Client. The provision
          of paragraph 3.6 above shall apply accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.8. In any case, Apiss shall be entitled to entrust part or all of
          the services to subcontractors, unless the parties have expressly
          agreed in the order that Apiss will perform them personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.9. If, in the course of providing the services, the need arises for
          additional work that was not included in the order, Apiss shall
          provide the Client with a list of the additional work necessary to be
          carried out and the remuneration due to Apiss on this account. The
          Client's acceptance of the offer to perform additional works shall
          mean its consent to the additional remuneration. In the event that the
          Client does not agree to the additional works, which in the opinion of
          Apiss determine the execution of the order, Apiss is entitled to
          withdraw from the contract. The provision of section 3.6 above shall
          apply accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.10. The date of completion of the order is given in the Service
          Report issued by Apiss after the completion of the provision of
          services. Signing of the Service Report by the Client's representative
          (in particular, by the ship's captain or superintendent) means
          confirmation of the completion by Apiss of the works listed in this
          document, their completion time and materials used.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.11. In the event that prior to the signing of the Service Report,
          the Client commences the operation of the equipment in relation to
          which Apiss performed the work specified in the order, it shall be
          deemed that the parties have accepted the work performed by Apiss
          without reservation.

        <p>
          4.4. Apiss undertakes to deliver the product on the date specified in
          the accepted delivery order. Apiss is entitled to postpone the

        </p>
        <p>
          6.2. Apiss is responsible only for the compliance of products and
          services provided with the contract and the mandatory provisions of
          the law. Apiss' liability is limited to the value of the services and
          products purchased by the Client. The parties hereby exclude, pursuant
          to Article 558 § 1 of the Civil Code, the liability of Apiss under the
          warranty.
        </p>
        <p>

          actual damage incurred by the Client, excluding any indirect damage,

          Apiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.4. Apiss' liability is excluded if the damage is caused by the use
          of materials or documentation provided by the Client which are
          inappropriate, used, worn out or contain defects.
        </p>
        <h5>7. Guarantee.</h5>
        <p>
          7.1. Apiss hereby guarantees that the products and services supplied
          in the performance of the contract will comply with the specifications
          of the accepted order.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.2. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in the contract, the
          guarantee period is:
        </p>
        <p>7.2.1. [_] months in respect of services provided by Apiss</p>
        <p>7.2.2. [_] months in relation to products supplied by Apiss.</p>
        <p>
          7.3. The period referred to in clause 7.2.1 above shall be calculated
          from the date of signing of the Service Report by the parties, and if
          the parties have not signed this document - from the date of
          termination of the provision of services by Apiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.4. The period referred to in clause 7.2.2 above shall be counted
          from the date of signing by the Client of the WZ document, and if the
          Client has not signed this document - from the date of delivery of the
          product to the Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.5. In the case of the supply or installation of new parts or
          modules, as well as the sale or supply of spare parts, the guarantee
          period indicated in the manufacturer's guarantee for a given part
          shall apply. All guarantee claims regarding such parts shall be
          submitted to the manufacturer of the part.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.6. Under the guarantee, Apiss undertakes to remove at its own
          expense, physical defects of the product or service performed, if
          these defects are revealed during the guarantee period and arise from
          causes inherent in the product sold or are a consequence of faulty
          performance of services by Apiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.7. The guarantee granted by Apiss does not cover defects and faults
          originating in materials or documentation provided by the Client, and
          also those which arise as a result of improper use of devices or
          products or mechanical damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.8. All complaints must be reported to Apiss during the guarantee
          period, in electronic form, in writing or by fax, within 3 days of the
          discovery of a defect. The guarantee does not cover defects, which
          were reported in a manner other than that specified above.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.9. Upon receipt of a complaint, Apiss within 14 days will verify its
          validity and issue a statement of acceptance or non-acceptance of the
          complaint. For this purpose, Apiss may commission an expert opinion
          from an independent entity or conduct an inspection through its
          representative.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.10. In order to properly conduct the complaint procedure, the Client
          is absolutely obliged to refrain from using the items in which a
          defect was detected and from any interference with the object
          (including the disassembly of the object) until Apiss issues a
          statement of acceptance or non-acceptance of the complaint and a
          possible inspection by a representative of Apiss. In the event of
          non-compliance by the Client with the obligations set out in the
          preceding sentence, as well as conducting an inspection of the object
          without the participation of a representative of Apiss, the guarantee
          shall expire.
        </p>
        <h5>8. Withdrawal of the execution of the order.</h5>
        <p>
          8.1. Until the completion of the execution of the order, the Client
          may withdraw from the order, with simultaneous payment to Apiss of the
          entire agreed remuneration and reimbursement of expenses incurred by
          Apiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2. If the Client’s performance of the contract is uncertain due to
          the Client’s financial condition, Apiss shall be entitled, at its
          discretion, to withhold the execution of the order until the Client
          has made full or agreed prepayment for the Apiss product or service or
          has provided Apiss with appropriate payment security.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.3. Apiss shall be entitled to withdraw from the contract if the
          Client fails to perform the necessary actions for the proper execution
          of the order by Apiss, in particular fails to provide the relevant
          parts, materials and documentation and fails to make available a
          suitable place for the provision of services. In the event of
          withdrawal from the contract, the Client shall reimburse Apiss all
          costs incurred by Apiss in order to perform the order.
        </p>
        <h5>9. Industrial property rights.</h5>
        <p>
          9.1. Apiss retains copyrights, patents and other industrial property
          rights to the subject of the contract delivered to the Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2. If the subject of delivery is software belonging to Apiss, the
          principles of licensing the use of this software shall be regulated by
          an agreement between Apiss and the Client. In the absence of such a
          separate agreement or regulations governing this issue, the provisions
          of this section 9 of the GCTS shall apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.3. Apiss grants the Client a non-exclusive licence to use the
          software.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.4. Subject to full and regular payment of licence fees, the Client
          shall receive a non-exclusive, valid for the duration of the licence
          agreement, non-transferable and non-sub-licensable right to use the
          software to the extent permitted under the agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.5. Contractual use includes the installation and loading, displaying
          and running of the installed software.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.6. Apiss is entitled to terminate the licence agreement in writing
          without notice for a justified reason. A justified reason, which
          entitles Apiss to terminate the contract, is primarily the violation
          of the Client’s rights of use by using the software beyond the scope
          specified in the contract and the failure to stop the violation within
          a reasonable period after receiving a warning from Apiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.7. The Client is not allowed to transfer the software, a copy of the
          software in the possession of the Client or any backup copy to third
          parties. In particular, the Client shall not be allowed to sell the
          software, license or sub-license it, make it public or make it
          available to the public unless it has obtained prior written consent
          to do so from Apiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.8. It is forbidden to copy accompanying materials (e.g.
          instructions) of the software without the consent of Apiss, to modify,
          carry out disassembly, decompilation or decryption of the working
          methods of the software, to create derivative works using the software
          or parts thereof.
        </p>
        <h5>10. Force Majeure.</h5>
        <p>
          10.1. Neither party shall be liable for non-performance or improper
          performance of its obligations under the agreement if such
          non-performance or improper performance is caused by force majeure.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.2. Force majeure shall be understood as an external event of
          extraordinary nature, beyond the control of the parties, which cannot
          be prevented with the use of the utmost diligence, in particular but
          not exclusively:
        </p>
        <p>10.2.1. decisions of the authorities;</p>
        <p>10.2.2. epidemics or pandemics;</p>
        <p>10.2.3. war, including civil war;</p>
        <p>10.2.4. riot, acts of sabotage, civil commotion;</p>
        <p>
          10.2.5. natural disasters such as storms, hurricanes, earthquakes,
          floods.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.3. Each party undertakes, as far as possible, to inform the other
          party of any events having the characteristics of force majeure that
          may affect the performance of obligations under the agreement so as to
          enable the other party to take measures to minimise the consequences
          of such event.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.4. If force majeure causes a party to fail to perform or improperly
          perform its obligations under the contract then:
        </p>
        <p>
          10.4.1. that party shall immediately notify the other party in writing
          at the address indicated as the party's registered address of the
          occurrence of such an event, and shall furthermore inform the other
          party of the relevant facts affecting the course of such an event, in
          particular the anticipated date of its termination and the anticipated
          date of the resumption of performance of the obligations under the
          contract and the termination of such an event, if possible providing
          documentation in this respect;
        </p>
        <p>10.4.2. the parties shall agree on how to deal with the event;</p>
        <p>
          10.4.3. that party shall commence remediation of the event without
          delay;
        </p>
        <p>
          10.4.4. each party shall exercise the utmost diligence for the proper
          performance of its obligations under the contract and shall promptly
          fulfil its obligations under the contract once the causes of the event
          and/or its consequences have been remedied.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.5. If a delay in performance continues for more than three months,
          the other party may terminate the contract with immediate effect.
        </p>
        <h5>11. Confidentiality.</h5>
        <p>
          11.1. Each party undertakes to keep strictly confidential all
          confidential information and facts of which it becomes aware in
          connection with the conclusion and performance of the agreement. This
          obligation also applies to documents, materials and any other
          information carriers. Confidential information is any information not
          disclosed to the public, irrespective of its legal, economic,
          organisational or any other nature, concerning the party and entities
          related to it by capital, contract or organisation. Confidential
          information also includes data and information concerning current,
          former and future employees, collaborators, suppliers and contractors
          of the parties. Confidential information includes, in particular, the
          business confidentiality referred to in Article 11 Cl. 4 of the Act of
          16 April 1993 on Combating Unfair Competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.2. The information referred to in clause 11.1 above may be
          disclosed only with the prior consent of the other party expressed in
          writing under pain of invalidity. The obligation of confidentiality
          shall also apply for 3 years after the termination of the agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.3. It shall not be a breach of confidentiality obligations to
          disclose information under mandatory provisions of law or a decision
          or order of a state authority or institution binding on one of the
          parties.
        </p>
        <h5>12. Final provisions.</h5>
        <p>
          12.1. All agreements concluded between Apiss and the Client are
          governed by Polish law. In the matters not regulated in GTCS and the
          contract between Apiss and the Client, the relevant provisions of
          Polish law shall apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          12.2. Any disputes arising between Apiss and the Client shall be
          settled by a common court competent in terms of substance for the
